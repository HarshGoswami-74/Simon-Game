Project Description: Simon Says Game

The Simon Says Game project is a digital adaptation of the classic memory game, "Simon Says," implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to provide users with an interactive and entertaining gaming experience while challenging their memory skills.

In the Simon Says Game, players are presented with a series of colored buttons that light up in a specific sequence. The objective is for players to remember and replicate the sequence correctly. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging, testing the player's ability to recall and reproduce the patterns accurately.

Key features of the Simon Says Game include:
Interactive Gameplay:- Users interact with the game by clicking on colored buttons to mimic the sequence shown.
Increasing Difficulty Levels:- The game dynamically adjusts the difficulty level as players progress, presenting longer and more complex sequences.
Feedback System:- Players receive immediate feedback on their input, indicating whether their sequence replication is correct or incorrect.
Game Over Screen:- When players make a mistake, the game ends, and a "Game Over" screen displays their final score.
Reset Option:- Players have the option to start a new game after reaching the end or encountering a game over.


The Simon Says Game project provides an enjoyable and challenging experience for players of all ages, offering an opportunity to test and improve memory skills while reliving the nostalgia of a beloved classic game. Whether played casually for entertainment or as a means of cognitive exercise, the Simon Says Game promises engaging gameplay and endless fun.
